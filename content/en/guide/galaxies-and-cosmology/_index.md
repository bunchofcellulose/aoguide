Galactic physics is the study of the structure, dynamics, and evolution of galaxies. It deals with the formation and evolution of galaxies, their components (such as stars, gas, dust, and dark matter), and the interactions between galaxies. Extragalactic astrophysics extends this study to the universe beyond our Milky Way galaxy, including the study of galaxy clusters, superclusters, and the large-scale structure of the universe.

Cosmology, a subfield of extragalactic astrophysics, focuses on the origin, evolution, and ultimate fate of the universe. It involves the study of the cosmic microwave background radiation, dark matter, dark energy, and the overall geometry of the universe.

In this unit, we will cover:

- The structure and components of galaxies
- Classification of galaxies
- Galactic relations
- The dynamics and evolution of galaxies
- The microwave background radiation
- Geometry of the universe and the FLRW metric
- Friedmann equations and cosmological models
