The practical portion of olympiads can be divided into two main categories: data analysis and observational astronomy. Both of these skills are essential for success in astronomy competitions.

## Data Analysis

Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, drawing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. It involves various techniques and tools to analyze data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods.

An amazing handout covering all of data analysis required for olympiads is [Data Analysis Handouts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CgIIxjSIAUOQv-DeLyvS4bZsv4IQ2wGr) by Ayush Tiwari, an IOAA 2025 participant from Nepal.

## Observational Astronomy

Olympiad participants are required to perform observational tasks, such as identifying constellations, using telescopes, or marking objects on star maps. These tasks require a good understanding of the night sky and the ability to use various tools and techniques for observation.

A great resource to get started with observational astronomy is [Practical Handout for Olympiad](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/6/folders/158MAxU6U2O_d_oUsVKrWfBywN4i5arN1) by Ayush Tiwari. This handout covers the basics of observational astronomy, including how to read star maps and identify constellations.
