The practical portion of olympiads can be divided into two main categories: data analysis and observational astronomy. Both of these skills are essential for success in astronomy competitions.

## Data Analysis

Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, drawing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. It involves various techniques and tools to analyze data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods.

## Observational Astronomy

Olympiad participants are required to perform observational tasks, such as identifying constellations, using telescopes, or marking objects on star maps. These tasks require a good understanding of the night sky and the ability to use various tools and techniques for observation.

Two great resources for mastery of both of these are the handouts of Ayush Tiwari and past Hong Kong IOAA team members, linked in the resources page.
