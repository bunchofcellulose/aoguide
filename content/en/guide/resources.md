- A really awesome and comprehensive [resource for IOAA](https://daniellee271828.github.io/ioaa_note_en.pdf) by former Hong Kong IOAA team members. Can be followed alongside the guide for a different perspective on topics.
- Sean Ken M. Galanza's [astronomy handouts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i7HR025iR4HO7PHhx7RmDCRa5aRi14hX?usp=sharing)
- Kevin Zhou's [Physics Olympiad Handouts](https://knzhou.github.io), mainly M6 and X3

## Practical

- [Practical Handouts for Olympiad](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Nft4B755uvtxfaSGLp2ZsVuHQGZ9pEt-) by Ayush Tiwari. Covers all aspects of data analysis and most observation skills required for IOAA.
- [Star Maps 101 and Practices](https://github.com/Rajit13/Star-Maps-101-and-Practices) by Fahim Rajit Hossain
- [Learn the Sky](https://www.youtube.com/@learnthesky) - A YouTube channel with videos on finding constellations, planets and navigating the sky.
- [Sky Academy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=digital.dong.skyacademy&hl=en_IN) - An android app which you can use to learn constellations, stars and Messier objects.
- [Stellar Guesser](https://stellarguesser.github.io/) - a tool for learning the sky in a game-like manner which I used to go from not knowing anything more than like 4 Messier objects and about 12 stars to knowing all the Messier and Caldwell objects and more than 70 stars well within the accuracy required for IOAA.
- Stellarium [Mobile App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noctuasoftware.stellarium_free&hl=en_IN) and [Desktop App](https://stellarium.org/) - A planetarium software that shows a realistic sky in 3D, just like what you see with the naked eye, binoculars or a telescope.
