    {{< tab name="P1: Neptune" >}}
    Given that Neptune will be at opposition on 21 September 2024, calculate in which year Neptune was last at opposition near the time of the northern-hemisphere spring equinox. Assume that the orbits of Earth and Neptune are circular.
    {{< /tab >}}

    {{< tab name="Solution" >}}
    1.  **Sidereal Period of Neptune ($P_N$):**

    Using Kepler's Third law and the semi-major axis ($a=30.070$ au) from the table of constants:
    $$P_{N}=(a^{3})^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sqrt{30.070^3} \approx 164.89 \mathrm{ years}$$

    2.  **Synodic Period ($S$):**

    Since Neptune is an outer planet, the synodic period $S$ is given by:
    $$\frac{1}{S}=\frac{1}{1 \mathrm{ year}}-\frac{1}{P_{N}}$$
    $$S = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{164.89}} \approx 1.0061 \mathrm{ years}$$
    In days: $1.0061 \times 365.2422 \approx 367.47$ days.

    3.  **Date Drift:**

    The date of opposition drifts by $D$ days per year:
    $$D = 367.47 - 365.24 = 2.23 \mathrm{ days/year}$$

    4.  **Year Calculation:**

    The northern spring equinox is approximately March 20. The difference between September 21 and March 20 is approximately 185 days.
    The number of years required is:
    $$\text{Years} = \frac{185}{2.23} \approx 83 \mathrm{ years}$$
    Year of desired opposition: $2024 - 83 = 1941$.

    {{< tab name="P2: Magnetic field" >}}
    An emission line of wavelength $\lambda=600$ nm was observed in the spectrum of a white dwarf. Assuming that it originates from the interaction of an electron with a magnetic field,

    (a) calculate the magnetic flux density of the field;

    (b) estimate the wavelength of another spectral line, the discovery of which could confirm that the lines originate from particles of a plasma interacting with the magnetic field.
    {{< /tab >}}

    {{< tab name="Solution" >}}
    **(a)** In a magnetic field, a charged particle moves along a circular path defined by the equality of centrifugal and magnetic forces:
    $$mv^{2}/r=evB$$
    The period is $T=2\pi m/eB$. The emitted wavelength is $\lambda=cT=2\pi mc/eB$. Thus:
    $$B=\frac{2\pi mc}{e\lambda}$$
    Substituting values:
    $$B \approx 1.8 \times 10^4 \mathrm{ T} = 20 \mathrm{ kT} \: \text{   (1 s.f.)}$$

    **(b)** In the plasma, protons will also be present. They will emit energy at a wavelength larger in proportion to the mass ratio:
    $$\lambda_p = \lambda_e \times \frac{m_p}{m_e} \approx 600 \mathrm{ nm} \times 1836 \approx 1 \mathrm{ mm}$$

    {{< tab name="P3: Microlensing" >}}
    A faint subdwarf star ($I=20.4$ mag) in the Galactic bulge was observed to brighten to $I'=15.2$ mag as a result of gravitational microlensing, allowing a high-resolution spectrum to be obtained with the UVES spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope (mirror diameter 8.2 m). Estimate the diameter of the telescope needed to obtain a spectrum of the same quality with the same instrument and exposure time for this star at its normal apparent brightness.
    {{< /tab >}}

    {{< tab name="Solution" >}}
    Let $A$ be the magnification factor.
    $$I - I' = 2.5 \log A \Rightarrow 20.4 - 15.2 = 5.2 = 2.5 \log A$$
    $$A = 10^{5.2/2.5} = 10^{2.08} \approx 120$$
    To collect the same number of photons from the unmagnified flux $F$ as the VLT did from the magnified flux $AF$, the new diameter $D$ must satisfy:
    $$F D^2 = (AF) D_{VLT}^2$$
    $$D = \sqrt{A} D_{VLT} \approx \sqrt{120} \times 8.2 \mathrm{ m} \approx 90 \mathrm{ m}$$

{{< tab name="P4: Europa" >}}
(a) Assuming that the ice covering the ocean on Jupiter's moon Europa is 6 km thick, that the surface temperature on the night side of Europa is 100 K and that the temperature at the ice-water boundary is 273 K, calculate the total power corresponding to the heat emitted from the interior of this moon.

(b) On Earth, the geothermal heat flux measured at the surface is $70\times10^{-3} \mathrm{ W m}^{-2}$ and originates mainly from radioactive decay. Is the heat emanating from the interior of Europa more likely to come from radioactive decay or tidal forces?

*Notes: the heat passing through a wall with a surface S and thickness d in time t is described by the formula:*
$$Q=\lambda S\Delta Tt/d$$
*where $\lambda$ stands for thermal conductivity and $\Delta T$ for the temperature difference.*

*The thermal conductivity of ice $\lambda=3 \mathrm{ W m}^{-1} \mathrm{ K}^{-1}$. The mass and radius of Europa are $4.8 \times 10^{22}$ kg and 1561 km.*
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab name="Solution" >}}
**(a)** Power per unit surface area ($P/S$):
$$P/S = \frac{Q}{S t} = \frac{\lambda \Delta T}{d} = \frac{3 \times (273 - 100)}{6000} \approx 90 \mathrm{ mW m}^{-2}$$
Total Power:
$$P_{total} = 4\pi R_{Eu}^2 (P/S) = 3 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{ W}$$

**(b)** The heat flux per unit area on Europa ($\sim 87 \text{ mW m}^{-2}$) is similar to Earth's ($\sim 70 \text{ mW m}^{-2}$). However, Earth's mass ($6 \times 10^{24}$ kg) is $\sim 124$ times larger than Europa's. For radioactive decay to be the cause, Europa would need $\sim 100$ times more radioactive material per unit mass than Earth, which is physically unlikely.
**Conclusion:** The heat comes from **tidal forces**.

{{< /tabs >}}{{< tabs >}}{{< tab name="P5: Dark Energy" >}}Observations indicate that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating. Fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background favour a flat (Euclidean) geometry, in which the total mass density (i.e. density of matter and equivalent mass density of all forms of energy) should be equal to the so-called critical density:$$\rho_{cr}=\frac{3 H_{0}^{2}}{8 \pi G}$$where $H_{0}$ is the present value of the Hubble constant. However, the total density of matter (luminous and dark) is estimated at $\rho_{m,0}\approx2.8\cdot10^{-27} \text{ kg m}^{-3}$. To resolve this discrepancy, the standard cosmological model assumes that the Universe is filled with a mysterious 'dark energy' of constant energy density $E_{\Lambda}$.Determine the value of $E_{\Lambda}$ and calculate for which redshift in the past the energy density equivalent to matter was equal to the density of dark energy. Neglect the contribution of electromagnetic radiation.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab name="Solution" >}}
1.  **Critical Density:**
    $$\rho_{cr} = \frac{3 H_0^2}{8\pi G} \approx 9.20 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg m}^{-3}$$
    (Using $H_0 \approx 70 \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{ Mpc}^{-1}$).

2.  **Dark Energy Density ($E_{\Lambda}$):**
    $$\rho_{m,0} + \frac{E_{\Lambda}}{c^2} = \rho_{cr}$$
    $$E_{\Lambda} = (\rho_{cr} - \rho_{m,0})c^2 = (9.20 - 2.8)\times 10^{-27} \times (3\times 10^8)^2 \approx 5.76 \times 10^{-10} \text{ J m}^{-3}$$

3.  **Redshift ($z_{eq}$):**
    Matter density at redshift $z$: $\rho_m(z) = \rho_{m,0}(1+z)^3$.
    Equating energy densities: $\rho_{m,0}(1+z)^3 c^2 = E_{\Lambda}$.
    $$1+z = \left( \frac{E_{\Lambda}}{\rho_{m,0} c^2} \right)^{1/3}$$
    $$z \approx 0.32$$

{{< /tabs >}}{{< tabs >}}{{< tab name="P6: Bolometer" >}}The entrance cavity of a particular bolometer is a cone with an opening angle of $30^{\circ}$, the surface of which has an energy absorption coefficient of $a=0.99$. Assume that there is no scattering of the incident radiation on the walls of the cavity, only multiple specular reflections. The bolometer is connected to a cooler which keeps the bolometer cavity surface at practically 0 K temperature. The instrument is orbiting at 2 au from the Sun and is pointed directly at the centre of the Solar disk.Calculate the temperature of a black body which would radiate the same amount of energy from a unit surface area as the bolometer opening does.

*Note: the opening angle is defined as twice the angle between the axis of the cone and its generatrix.*

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab name="Solution" >}}
1.  **Incident Flux:**
    Solar luminosity $L_{\odot} \approx 3.826 \times 10^{26}$ W. Distance $r = 2$ au.
    $$F_{in} = \frac{L_{\odot}}{4\pi r^2} \approx 340.1 \text{ W m}^{-2}$$

2.  **Reflection Analysis:**
    The cone angle is $30^\circ$ (semi-angle $15^\circ$).
    A ray entering parallel to the axis hits the wall at $15^\circ$.
    Reflection 1: angle with axis $15^\circ \times 2 = 30^\circ$.
    Reflection 2: angle with axis $30^\circ + 30^\circ = 60^\circ$ (geometry shows the angle increases by $2 \times$ semi-angle each time).
    It takes 6 reflections for the ray to turn around and exit ($6 \times 15^\circ = 90^\circ$ turn relative to normal, sending it out).
    Fraction of energy remaining $S = (1-a)^6 = (0.01)^6 = 10^{-12}$.

3.  **Effective Temperature:**
    Flux out $\Phi = F_{in} \times S = 340.1 \times 10^{-12} \text{ W m}^{-2}$.
    Using Stefan-Boltzmann law $\Phi = \sigma T^4$:
    $$T = \left( \frac{340.1 \times 10^{-12}}{5.67 \times 10^{-8}} \right)^{1/4} \approx 0.28 \text{ K}$$

{{< /tabs >}}{{< tabs >}}{{< tab name="P7: Libration" >}}As a result of libration, studied among others by Johannes Hevelius, more than half of the Moon's surface can be observed from Earth. Assume that the observer is geocentric.(a) Estimate $\phi_{B}$, the maximum angle of libration in latitude. The axial tilt (obliquity) of the Moon with respect to its orbital plane is $\alpha=6^{\circ}41^{\prime}$.

(b) Estimate $\phi_{L}$ the maximum angle of libration in longitude. Assume that the Moon is always aligned with the same side facing towards the second focus F2 of its orbit, and that the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit $e$ changes between 0.044 and 0.064 on a timescale of several months.

(c) Estimate the fraction of the Moon's surface which can be seen from Earth.

(d) Calculate how many months (lunations) are needed for an observer to see the Moon's surface determined in part (c).
(20 points)


{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab name="Solution" >}}
**(a)** Libration in latitude corresponds to the Moon's obliquity:
$$\phi_B = \alpha = 6^{\circ} 41'$$

**(b)** Libration in longitude is maximized at the point in orbit where the difference between true anomaly and mean anomaly is greatest (or geometrically using the empty focus).
$\sin(\phi_L/2) = e_{max}$.
Using $e=0.064$: $\phi_L = 2 \arcsin(0.064) \approx 7.34^{\circ} = 7^{\circ} 20'$.

**(c)** The average libration angle is roughly $\phi_{avg} \approx 7^{\circ}$. The visible area is $50\%$ plus the belt revealed by libration.
Width of belt angle $\approx 7^{\circ}$.
Fraction $\approx 50\% + \frac{7}{360} \times 100 \times \pi$ (since it applies to the circumference area).
More accurately: Fraction $= 0.5 + \frac{1}{2}\sin(\phi_{avg}) \approx 0.5 + \frac{1}{2}(0.12) = 0.56$ or $56\%$.

**(d)** We need the beat period between the Libration in Latitude period (Draconic month $P_B \approx 27.21$ d) and Libration in Longitude period (Anomalistic month $P_L \approx 27.55$ d).
$$\frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{P_B} - \frac{1}{P_L}$$
$$T \approx 74 \text{ lunations}$$
To see the full range (extremes on both sides), we need half this cycle: $\approx 37$ months.

{{< /tabs >}}{{< tabs >}}{{< tab name="P8: Neutrinos" >}}In a simplified model of a supernova explosion, the core of a star, composed of pure iron ${}_{26}^{56}\text{Fe}$ nuclei with a total mass of 1 $M_{\odot}$, changes into a neutron star composed of individual electrons, protons and neutrons in numerical proportions of 1:1:8. This process is called 'neutronization' and results in the emission of a large number of neutrinos.Calculate the solar neutrino flux on Earth. How much larger would the flux of neutrinos reaching the Earth from the supernova be than the steady neutrino emission of the Sun, if the supernova exploded in the centre of the Galaxy and the process of neutronization of the core took about 0.01 s? Give an order-of-magnitude answer.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab name="Solution" >}}
1.  **Supernova Flux:**
    Number of iron nuclei $n_{Fe} = M_{\odot} / m_{Fe} \approx 2.14 \times 10^{55}$.
    Initial protons $n_p = 26 n_{Fe}$.
    Final state (1:1:8 ratio): Protons $n_p' = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{total nucleons} = \frac{56}{10} n_{Fe}$.
    Change in protons = Neutrinos emitted $\approx 4.2 \times 10^{56}$.
    Distance $d = 8 \text{ kpc}$. Time $t = 0.01$ s.
    Flux $F_{SN} = \frac{N_{\nu}}{4\pi d^2 t} \approx 5.5 \times 10^{16} \text{ m}^{-2} \text{ s}^{-1}$.

2.  **Solar Flux:**
    Sun produces energy via p-p chain ($4p \to He + 2\nu + 26.7 \text{ MeV}$).
    Reactions/sec $= L_{\odot} / 26.7 \text{ MeV}$.
    Neutrinos/sec $= 2 \times$ Reactions $\approx 1.8 \times 10^{38}$.
    Flux $F_{\odot} \approx \frac{1.8 \times 10^{38}}{4\pi (1 \text{ au})^2} \approx 6.4 \times 10^{14} \text{ m}^{-2} \text{ s}^{-1}$.

{{< /tabs >}}{{< tabs >}}{{< tab name="P9: Second eclipse" >}}For each of two eclipsing binary systems, Bolek and Lolek, the primary eclipses were observed with very high cadence as depicted below:*Figure 1: Observed lightcurve for system Bolek.* (Shows a sharp V-shaped minimum).
*Figure 2: Observed lightcurve for system Lolek.* (Shows a flat-bottomed minimum).

In the figures, t is the time in hours relative to the moment of minimum and V is the brightness in the V (visible) band in magnitudes. The points are the measurements and the line is the fitted model of the shape of the eclipse. You can assume that in both cases the eclipses are central ($i=90^{\circ}$) and last for a very small fraction of the orbital period, limb darkening is negligible, and the orbits have low eccentricity.

On the Answer Sheet, draw the predicted shape of the light curve for each of the secondary eclipses. Write down the equations and calculations leading to your predictions.
(20 points)


{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab name="Solution" >}}
**System Bolek:**
The primary eclipse is sharp (V-shaped), implying $R_1 = R_2$ (partial/grazing but central implies total at a single point).
Using Pogson's law on the depths: The luminosity ratio $L_2/L_1$ can be derived from the depth.
Since $R_1=R_2$, the secondary eclipse will have a similar shape but the depth depends on the surface brightness/temperature ratio. However, without temperature info, we assume circular orbits and similar conditions.
Calculations show $L_2/L_1 = 2$.
The secondary eclipse is V-shaped with depth $\approx 0.44$ mag.

**System Lolek:**
The primary eclipse is flat-bottomed, implying $R_1 \neq R_2$ (one star fully occults the other).
The ratio of flat-time to fall-time gives $R_2/R_1 = 2$.
The depth implies equal surface brightness ($S_1 = S_2$).
If surface brightness is equal, the secondary eclipse has the **same depth** as the primary.
Shape: Flat-bottomed, depth $\approx 0.25$ mag.

{{< /tabs >}}{{< tabs >}}{{< tab name="P10: Aldebaran" >}}On 9 March 1497, Nicolaus Copernicus observed the occultation of Aldebaran by the Moon from Bologna. In his work De revolutionibus orbium cœlestium Copernicus described the event: "I saw the star touching the dark edge of the Moon and disappearing at the end of the 5th hour of the night between the horns of the Moon, closer to the south horn by a third of the Moon's diameter."Assuming that the occultation was observed on the local meridian, that at maximum occultation Aldebaran was $0.32'$ above the southern edge of the Moon, and that the apparent angular diameter of the Moon as seen from Bologna was $31.5'$, solve the following tasks:

(a) Find the latitude $\varphi_{1}$ of a place with the same longitude as Bologna, from which Aldebaran would have appeared to pass behind the centre of the Moon.

(b) Find the duration of the occultation as seen from latitude $\varphi_{1}$ if Aldebaran appeared to pass along the diameter of the lunar disk. For simplicity, also assume that the Moon and the observer are moving linearly at constant speed, that the Moon's orbit is circular and that the declination of the Moon does not change during the occultation.

(c) Find the topocentric angular velocity of the Moon against the background stars during the occultation for an observer at latitude $\varphi_{1}$, in arcmin/hour, applying the same assumptions as in part (b).

(d) Estimate the range of the Moon's topocentric angular velocities (against the background stars) in arcmin/hour at latitude $\varphi_{1}$, assuming a circular orbit. Show how this result can be justified by expressing the relative velocity of the Moon and observer in terms of their velocity vectors.

*The declination of Aldebaran was $\delta_{A}=15.37^{\circ}$ in 1497 (due to precession), and the latitude of Bologna is $\varphi_{B}=44.44^{\circ}$ N.*

**(a) Latitude $\varphi_1$:**
Parallax geometry: The displacement needed is from the chord ($0.32'$ from edge) to the center.
Using Earth radius $r$ and distance to Moon:
$\varphi_1 = \arcsin\left(\frac{4801 \text{ km}}{6378 \text{ km}}\right) + \delta_A \approx 64.2^\circ$.

**(b) Duration:**
Velocity of observer at $\varphi_1$: $v_{obs} = \frac{2\pi R \cos\varphi_1}{23.93 \text{ h}} \approx 729 \text{ km/h}$.
Velocity of Moon: $v_{Moon} \approx 3683 \text{ km/h}$.
Relative velocity (same direction): $v_{rel} = v_{Moon} - v_{obs} = 2954 \text{ km/h}$.
Diameter of Moon shadow $\approx 2 \times 1737$ km.
Duration $t = \frac{3474}{2954} \approx 1.18 \text{ hours}$.

**(c) Angular Velocity:**
Distance to Moon $d$ at this latitude $\approx 380203$ km.
$\omega = \frac{\text{Angular Diameter}}{t} = \frac{31.5'}{1.18 \text{ h}} \approx 27 \text{ arcmin/h}$.

**(d) Range:**
Min velocity (at meridian): $v_{rel} = v_{Moon} - v_{obs}$ (calculated above).
Max velocity (when Moon is opposite, e.g., due North/South relative to motion): $v_{rel} = v_{Moon} + v_{obs}$.
Max $\omega \approx \frac{3683+729}{3683-729} \times 27 \approx 40 \text{ arcmin/h}$.
Range: $27 - 40$ arcmin/h.

The spacecraft hit Dimorphos, a moon of the asteroid Didymos, to study how the impact affected its orbit.(a) Calculate the expected orbital period change (in minutes), assuming that the collision was head-on, central, and perfectly inelastic. Assume that before the impact Dimorphos orbited Didymos on a circular orbit with a period of $P=11.92$ h. The masses of Dimorphos and Didymos are $m=4.3\times10^{9}$ kg and $M=5.6\times10^{11}$ kg, respectively. The mass and speed of the DART spacecraft relative to Dimorphos at a moment of impact were $m_{s}=580 \text{ kg}$ and $v_{s}=6.1 \text{ km s}^{-1}$. Neglect the gravitational influence of other bodies.

(b) In reality, the orbital period of Dimorphos was observed to be changed by $\Delta P_{0}=-33$ min. This is due to the momentum transfer associated with the recoil of the ejected debris: the spacecraft was absorbed by the asteroid, but the impact excavated some material from the asteroid and ejected it into space. Calculate the momentum of the ejected debris and express it as a fraction of the momentum of Dimorphos before the collision. You can assume that the mass of the ejected material is much smaller than the mass of Dimorphos.

It consists of three spacecraft arranged in an equilateral triangle. A passing gravitational wave changes the distance between the spacecraft, which can be precisely measured (more details are given in the notes below).One of the sources of low-frequency gravitational waves are compact binary star systems, for example binary white dwarfs. Such a system was recently discovered at a distance of 2.34 kpc from the Sun. The orbital period of the binary was found to be 414.79 s and is changing at a rate of $-7.49\times10^{-4} \text{ s yr}^{-1}$ due to the emission of gravitational waves.

$\mathcal{M} = \left( \frac{5 c^5}{192 \pi} \dot{P} \right)^{3/5} \frac{c^3}{G} \frac{P}{2\pi} \approx 0.319 M_{\odot}$.

**(c) Component Masses:**
Constraint 1: Chirp mass $\mathcal{M} = 0.319 M_{\odot}$.
Constraint 2: Kepler's law with $R_1/a = 0.139$. $M_1+M_2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G P^2} (\frac{R_1}{0.139})^3$.
Iterating with the provided Mass-Radius table:
$M_1 \approx 0.55 M_{\odot}$ and $M_2 \approx 0.25 M_{\odot}$.
